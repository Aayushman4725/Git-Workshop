##Using multiple github account in one machine

For ssh key generation:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Generate different key for different email i.e different github account
Dont forget to change the names of the ssh keys.
When you enter the above code it asks you where to show the ssh keys by default it stores in:
 C:\Users\DELL/.ssh/id_ed25519

just copy this path and add _username(you can use any name you like just make it unique because when you generate two different keys it will store in as same name by default which is:"id_ed25519") at the end:

 C:\Users\DELL/.ssh/id_ed25519_username(or any other name)

In my case, as my github username was 'longeval':
C:\Users\DELL/.ssh/id_ed25519_longeval



Inside the .ssh folder which will be inside Users/Username  (In my case Users/DELL)
Open a code editor from the .ssh folder (for eg: vs code)

Create a file called "config"

Now inside the config file add this:

Host longeval github.com
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_longeval

Host aayushman4725 github.com
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_aayushman4725


After the Host I have written longeval and aayushman.4725  for my two ssh keys of two different account which are just aliases/nickname(can be written anything) which we will need when cloning the repo.
Now save the file.
Now that we have configured our ssh keys, its time to test it out by cloning

for that just go to the folder in which you have to clone and in the terminal type : git clone git@github.com:Nepal-College-of-Information-Technology/lab-works-Longeval.git

Now in the above code after "git clone"
there is git@github.com written there.

Replace that with git@longeval (replace the github.com with the alias which we setup previously, in my case I cloned the repo from 
the account whose username is longeval) so my code would be:
git@longeval:Nepal-College-of-Information-Technology/lab-works-Longeval.git
